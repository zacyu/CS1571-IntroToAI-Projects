# CS1571-IntroToAI-Projects
Programming projects for CS 1571 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence), lectured by Dr. Litman at the University of Pittsburgh.

## Introduction
This directory contains the programming sections of the assignments I completed for CS 1571 course in Fall 2017 at the University of Pittsburgh. There are four assignments in total, three of them contains programming sections.

## Projects
### [Homework 1: Graph Searches](project1)
Model three different applied problems as graph searches, and solve each with breadth-first, iterative-deepening, uniform-cost, greedy, and A* algorithms respectively.

### Homework 2
Omitted as it does not contain a programming section.

### [Homework 3: FOL Inference](project3)
Build a simplified FOL solver implementing forward-chaining algorithm.

### [Homework 4: Naive Bayes (Spam Detection)](project4)
Create a Naive Bayes classifier for detecting e-mail spam, and test it on a publicly available spam dataset using 5-fold cross-validation.
